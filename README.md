# block-chain
Implement a blockchain Python application that keeps track of blockchain branches and appends new  blocks to the longest branch. In order to append a block, the block contain a 64bit nonce that causes the  hash to start with N zeros. Each block should contain a random list of transactions. Objectives: 1) Control the puzzle hardness by varying N so that the block chain grows at 1 block per second. 2) Simulate an attack on the blockchain: There is a chance that an attacker appears and tries to grow  his own branch of the blockchain, by appending to a previous block (not the latest verified block). The attack speed is a predetermined parameter. 3) By experimentation, find the attack speed where an attack is successful (the main branch is  replaced with the attackerâ€™s branch), and compare it to the legit blockchain speed.
